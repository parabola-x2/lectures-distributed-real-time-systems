# README Lectures Multi Sensor Data Fusion

## Lecture Overview

1. Sensor Characteristicts based on State, Performance and Measurement techniques
2. Uncertainities in sensor measurement
3. Definition of a sensor model
4. Sensor networks - Single, Parallel, Cascaded and Iterative
5. Data fusion models - JDL, TRIP, Omibus, Dasarathy
6. Data fusion modes - Low level (raw data) fusion, Intermediate level (feature) fusion and High level (decision) fusion
7. Data fusion architecture - Centralized and Distributed architecture
8. Common representation data format : Spatial and Temporal

* Spatial : Intensity based automatic image registration, Control point registration, Phase correlation
* Temporal : Dynamic Time Warping

9. Data fusion networks - Complementary and Cooperative

* Complementary: Angular sensor using Accelerometer (in low intertia) and Gyroscope (in higher inertia)
* Cooperative: Triangulation, Trilateration and Bayer theorem

10. Further Materials:&#x20;

* Mitchell, HB : Multi Sensor Data Fusion
* Jitendra R. Raol : Multi Sensor Data Fusion with MATLAB.
* Matlab Image Processing Toolbox Help
* Hochschule Esslingen : Inertial Navigation System Sensor Fusion.
